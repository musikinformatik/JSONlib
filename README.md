# JSONlib

> A JSON de- and encoder for SuperCollider

The JSON implementation of the SuperCollider standard library lacks certain features such as

* [ ] lack of a JSON encoder (the conversion of an dictionary to a JSON string)
* [ ] parsing JSON values into their respective type (`.parseJSON` converts everything to a string)

which this Quark implements, building on top of the existing implementation.
